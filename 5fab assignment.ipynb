    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the practice of exposing only the relevant information and hiding the complexity of the implementation. It allows the user to focus on what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and functions that operate on that data within a single unit or object. This protects the data from accidental corruption and provides a secure way to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class can be derived from an existing class. The derived class inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the parent class and can also have its own attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This is achieved in OOP by defining methods with the same name in different classes that are related by inheritance. When a method is called on an object, the correct implementation of that method is executed based on the object's actual class.\n",
